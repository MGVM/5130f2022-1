Project Topic: Ideal Gaming Experience

Lot of gamers struggle to find the Ideal graphic and performance settings like Screen resolution, FPS (Frames per second) settings and more in-game tweaks which help in enhancing the experience while playing a particular game. 

A one stop website suggesting system and graphic settings for games with regard to the PC configuration would go a long way in helping gamers with enhancing their gaming experience. 

For example: 

Game: League of legends  

Setting suggestions: 

Processor: Intel i5, screen resolution: 1920 x 200 P 
           Intel i3, Screen resolution: 1366 x 768 P etc....
                   

Not everyone can afford the latest and best technology for gaming, with the ever-evolving gaming industry which is constantly wanting higher powered CPUs and GPUs for the games to run smoothly. 

This Website would suggest gamers the ideal settings based on the game and the computer/gaming console they currently own. 

Note: This is different from the general system requirement which the game developers provide that require gamers to have the latest technology. 

The website we plan to develop would have in- game settings where the game can run on a range of systems.

These recommendations will help them to have a better gaming experience with what they have, rather than spending thousands of dollars on buying expensive gaming laptops / consoles.

While they might not have the true feel of the game with high powered systems, but they can enjoy the game without having to struggle with unwanted game crashes and lags due to game settings.
